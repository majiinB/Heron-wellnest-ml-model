    "# Basis for Synthetic Dataset Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This synthetic dataset generator simulates student well-being classifications based on heuristic rules, enforced class distributions, and controlled outliers. These design choices mirror real-world conditions where mental health data is often noisy, imbalanced, and influenced by overlapping emotional states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. High-level assumptions\n",
    "- Each row = a single daily log for a user (one user-day).\n",
    "- Every user must choose 1–3 moods/day (so at least one mood bit = 1).\n",
    "- Journaling (free-text) is optional per day; if no journal → all `p_* = 0.0`.\n",
    "- Gratitude entry is optional and recorded as a binary flag.\n",
    "- `WellbeingClass` is the label of record, derived primarily from moods, secondarily modulated by journaling probabilities and gratitude.\n",
    "- There are 4 WellbeingClasses: `InCrisis`, `Struggling`, `Excelling`, `Thriving`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. Target class-level population distribution\n",
    "These percentages reflect a plausible population-level mix for an app balancing support vs normal users. (adjust based on CGCS expectations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on research into the prevalence of mental health conditions among Filipino university students and young adults, this model proposes a realistic and balanced distribution for the synthetic dataset. Unlike earlier drafts, **this version removes the \"Surviving\" category** to better align with the finalized heuristic rules in the generator.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of five classes, we now use four: **Excelling, Thriving, Struggling, and In Crisis.** This structure matches the logic applied in the data generator and avoids artificial overlap between \"Struggling\" and \"Surviving.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Distribution\n",
    "* **Excelling:** **3–5%**\n",
    "* **Thriving:** **7–10%**\n",
    "* **Struggling:** **25–30%**\n",
    "* **In Crisis:** **15–20%**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale and Research-Backed Justification\n",
    "This model maintains evidence-based prevalence rates while making the class taxonomy cleaner and more practical for ML training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Excelling (3–5%) & Thriving (7–10%)**  \n",
    "  These categories correspond to the \"Flourishing\" group in the AXA Mind Health Report, which found that only **15%** of young people in Asia are flourishing. We split this into two tiers:\n",
    "  - *Excelling* → the true high-performers, a smaller share (3–5%).  \n",
    "  - *Thriving* → doing very well but not at the extreme top (7–10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Struggling (25–30%)**  \n",
    "  Supported by studies like Mendoza et al. (2021), which showed **over 23%** of Filipino university students experienced severe anxiety symptoms. This category captures those with significant distress but not at crisis level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Crisis (15–20%)**  \n",
    "  Higher than some global estimates, but justified by local data. Tria (2015) found **24% prevalence of suicide ideation** among Manila university students. This category represents both acute suicidal risk and severe clinical distress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"Surviving\" Was Removed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap with Struggling:** In practice, the \"Surviving\" category captured milder distress, but the boundary between \"Surviving\" and \"Struggling\" was blurry. This weakened class separation.  \n",
    "- **Heuristic Consistency:** The current labeling rules classify such cases under **Struggling** (moderate anxiety or depression), making a separate category redundant.  \n",
    "- **Simpler, Cleaner Taxonomy:** By reducing to four classes, the dataset avoids artificial middle-ground states and ensures each label has clear, actionable meaning for training and downstream interpretation.\n",
